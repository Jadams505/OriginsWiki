				The <b>Defiled Ekko</b> is an [link enemy | | Enemies.html] found in the [link Defiled Wastelands] all throughout the game after the player has reached 400 max [link life | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health].
				Defiled Ekkoes follow the behaviors of [link Town NPCs | | NPCs.html], except with hostility towards the player and various weapons they could use.
				Defiled Ekkoes can use their own version of the [link Infusion], [link Dismay] and [link Bone Latcher] that each scale with difficulty.
				In [link Master Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode], Defiled Ekkoes gain the benefits of [link Mysterious Spray] once [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] is reached.
