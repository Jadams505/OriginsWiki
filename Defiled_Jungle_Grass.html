					 - Defiled Jungle Grass can be quickly removed after being shot by a projectile, but will quickly reclaim that ground within seconds.
					 This is a part of the [link Defiled Resurgence] mechanic where the Defiled cannot be cleansed until all [link Defiled Hearts | | Defiled_Heart.html] are removed from the world.
