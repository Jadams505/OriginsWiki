			<h1>Stun</h1>

			<p>The <b>Stun</b> mechanic is included in a few debuffs featured in Origins. The mechanic involves freezing an entity in place for a set amount of time preventing<br>
			them from attacking or doing anything unless specified. Currently, the Stun mechanic is featured in the '[link Rasterize]' and '[link Toxic Shock]' debuffs, and behaves<br>
			differently in both.</p>
