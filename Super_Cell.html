				The <b>Super Cell</b> is a [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link magic weapon | | Magic_Weapons.html] that has a 1/5 (20%) chance of being dropped by [link Riven Mimics | | Riven_Mimic].
				When used, the player transforms into a free-flying, amebic blob that emits smaller, bouncing blobs depending on the player's [link life regeneration | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health_regeneration] rate.
				While in this form, the player can deal damage and inflict [link Torn] to enemies on contact or from an emitted mini-blob, but cannot regenerate, and lose life and [link mana | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Mana] while transformed.
				The player is also immune to all forms of damage and cannot use other items while transformed as well.
