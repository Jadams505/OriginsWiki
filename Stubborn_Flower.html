			<p>
				The <b>Stubborn Flower</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link summon weapon | | Summon_Weapons.html] that is crafted from [link Biocomponent 10], [link NE-8], and a [link Survey Sprout].
				It summons a Mechanical Giant [link minion | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Summon_weapons#Minions] that attacks enemies through contact damage.
				Uniquely, the giant also doubles as a ridable mount where the player can sit on its shoulder away from enemies and have a height advantage.
				Using the Flower multiple times makes Mechanical Giant stronger and faster, much like [link Abigail's Flower | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Abigail%27s_Flower].
				The giant's status can be indicated by its glowing internals depending on the color of its flame.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Stubborn Flower is a [link lore item | | Lore_Item.html] indicated by "You hear whispers nearby..."
			</p>

			<p>
				Stubborn Flower's best [link modifier | | Modifiers.html] is <b>Mythical</b>, <b>Ruthless</b>, or <b>Godly</b>.
				The Mechanical Giant deals great damage to benefit from any damage bonuses.

				<summary>Tips<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					- The most optimal location for the Mechanical Giant is on the surface where it has plenty of room to navigate.
					- Due to the Mechanical Giant's damage output, it serves as a really strong alternative to early [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] weapons.
