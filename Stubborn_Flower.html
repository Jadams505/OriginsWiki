				The <b>Stubborn Flower</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Summon_Weapons.html">summon weapon</a> that is crafted from <a is="a-link">Biocomponent 10</a>, <a is="a-link">NE-8</a>, and a <a is="a-link">Survey Sprout</a>.
				It summons a Mechanical Giant <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Summon_weapons#Minions">minion</a> that attacks enemies through contact damage.
				Uniquely, the giant also doubles as a ridable mount where the player can sit on its shoulder away from enemies and have a height advantage.
				Using the Flower multiple times makes Mechanical Giant stronger and faster, much like <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Abigail%27s_Flower">Abigail's Flower</a>.
				The giant's status can be indicated by its glowing internals depending on the color of its flame.

				The Stubborn Flower is a <a is="a-link" href="Lore_Item.html">lore item</a> indicated by "You hear whispers nearby..."

			<p>
				Stubborn Flower's best <a is="a-link" href="Modifiers.html">modifier</a> is <b>Mythical</b>, <b>Ruthless</b>, or <b>Godly</b>.
				The Mechanical Giant deals great damage to benefit from any damage bonuses.

					 - The Mechanical Giant is a grounded minion and does not have a ranged attack, greatly limiting its effectiveness in airborne situations.
					 - The giant is large and cannot fit in most spaces where the player can.

				<summary>Tips<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					 - The most optimal location for the Mechanical Giant is on the surface where it has plenty of room to navigate.
					 - Due to the Mechanical Giant's damage output, it serves as a really strong alternative to early <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> weapons.
