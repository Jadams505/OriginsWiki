				<p>
					 - Refactoring Pieces' effect is stackable with other mana shielding boosts.
					 - Mana shielding takes into account the damage the player would have received with 0 defense and 0% damage reduction.
					 This results in the proper amount of<br> damage deducted from the attack, but an inefficiency in the mana consumed from it.<br>
					 - Whenever the player benefits from mana shielding, [link Defiled Exhaustion] will be applied preventing any mana regneration for 0.83 seconds.
