				<p>
					 - Refactoring Pieces' effect is stackable with other mana shielding boosts (see [link item synergies | | Item_Synergies#Mana_Shielding.html]).
					 - Mana shielding takes into account the damage the player would have received with 0 defense and 0% damage reduction.
					This results in the proper amount of damage reduced from the attack, but an inefficiency in the mana consumed from it.
					 - Whenever the player benefits from mana shielding, [link Defiled Exhaustion] will be applied preventing any mana regneration for 3.2 seconds.
