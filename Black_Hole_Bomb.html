				The <b>Black Hole Bomb</b> is a type of post-[link Moon Lord | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon_Lord] [link explosive | | Demolitionist_Weapons.html] that can be obtained from the [link Elderforge] after completing the [link Test of the Ancients].
				The Black Hole Bomb remains in place after landing on a [link tile | | Blocks.html] or [link enemy | | Enemies.html] and generates a growing black hole that has an incredible pull force that pulls in any entities and items nearby it.
				While expanding, the black hole will deal 10% of its base damage to any enemies inside of it.
				After expanding for a short time, the black hole will collapse dealing impressive damage and destroying any tiles within its blast radius.

				<p>
					 - The Black Hole Bomb is one of the best Demolitionist weapons in Origins due to its ability to pull enemies towards it.
					 However, it is especially effective against worm-type enemies where it can damage all of the segments with the same damage during its growth and eventual explosion.
					 - On the contrary, Black Hole Bombs suffer against bosses that share the a similar design to [link Plantera | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Plantera], and will instead be pushed back with the same amount of force used to pull them in.
