				<b>Defiled Grass</b> is a [link block | | Blocks.html] type found in the [link Defiled Wastelands].
				It is the Defiled-equivalent to [link Grass | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Grasses], and can be converted to other variants with [link any thrown powder | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Thrown_Powder].
				Defiled Grass can be placed and spread using [link Defiled Seeds].
				Given enough time, [link foliage | | Plants.html] will start to grow on top of Defiled Grass.

					 - Defiled Grass can be quickly removed after being shot by a projectile, but will quickly reclaim that ground within seconds.
					 This is a part of the [link Defiled Resurgence] mechanic where the Defiled cannot be cleansed until all [link Defiled Hearts | | Defiled_Heart.html] are removed from the world.
