				The <b>Defiled Asphyxiator</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> that occasionally spawns in an <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ocean">Ocean</a> overtaken by the <a is="a-link">Defiled Wastelands</a>.
				The Defiled Asphyxiator will fire projectiles similar to the <a is="a-link">Defiled Amalgamation</a>'s "projectile spray" above the player, spawning falling defiled stones towards the player.
				If the defiled stones land on the player and crush them, they will cause the player to lose all of their <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Breath_meter">breath</a> and receive <a is="a-link">Rasterized</a> for 3 seconds.
				The Asphyxiator will also attempt to intercept the player as well.

					 - The greatest way to counter the Defiled Asphyxiator's main attack is by placing tiles directly above to block the stones.
					The player should be wary that the Asphyxiator will also try to attack the player through contact as well and can float through tiles.
