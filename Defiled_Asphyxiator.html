				The <b>Defiled Asphyxiator</b> is a [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] [link enemy | | Enemies.html] that occasionally spawns in an [link Ocean | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ocean] overtaken by the [link Defiled Wastelands].
				The Defiled Asphyxiator will fire projectiles similar to the [link Defiled Amalgamation]'s "projectile spray" above the player spawns falling defiled stone towards the player.
				If the defiled stones land on the player and crush them, they will cause the player to lose all of their [link breath | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Breath_meter] and inflict [link Rasterized] for 3 seconds.
				The Asphyxiator will also attempt to intercept the player as well.

					 - The greatest way to counter the Defiled Asphyxiator's main attack is by placing tiles directly above to block the stones.
					 The player should be wary that the Asphyxiator will also try to attack the player through contact as well and can float through tiles.
