				<b>Minions</b> are mobile characters summoned by the player to fight for them.
				They are primarily used by <a is="a-link" href="Summon_Weapons.html">summoners</a> as a primary source of damage in combat.
				Some armor sets are able to summon minions of their own, but they are mainly summoned through weapons.
				Certain minions act as conventional <a is="a-link">NPCs</a> and have stats of their own such as <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health">health</a>, which are generally summoned by <a is="a-link">Artifacts</a> (separate from other summoning weapons).
			</p>

			<p>
				Minions require <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Mana">mana</a> and minion slots to be summoned of which only one minion can be summoned at a time generally.
				However, there are some items that can reduce the mana cost and increase the minion slots a player has in order to summon more and less costly.
				Different types of minions can be deployed at the same time, so long as the player has enough minion slots.
