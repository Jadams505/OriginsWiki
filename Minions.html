				<b>Minions</b> are mobile characters summoned by the player to fight for them.
				They are primarily used by [link summoners | | Summon_Weapons.html] as a primary source of damage in combat.
				Some armor sets are able to summon minions of their own, but they are mainly summoned through weapons.
				Certain minions act as conventional [link NPCs] and have stats of their own such as [link health | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health], which are generally summoned by [link Artifacts] (separate from other summoning weapons).
			</p>

			<p>
				Minions require [link mana | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Mana] and minion slots to be summoned of which only one minion can be summoned at a time generally.
				However, there are some items that can reduce the mana cost and increase the minion slots a player has in order to summon more and less costly.
				Different types of minions can be deployed at the same time, so long as the player has enough minion slots.
