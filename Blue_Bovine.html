			<p>
				<b>Blue Bovine</b> is a [link food] item that is sold by the [link Merchant | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Merchant] [link NPC | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/NPCs] after completing his 'To the Skies!' [link quest | | Quests.html].
				When consumed, it provides the <b>Bovine Flight</b> [link buff | | Buffs.html], which gives the player a temporary set of [link wings].
				This effect will last for 4 minutes, but can be canceled anytime by right-clicking the icon.
			</p>

			<p>
				Like most wings, the soda wings allow the player to slow their fall by holding down the Jump key and will not take any [link fall damage | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Fall_damage].
				Its flight speed and power are overall stronger than [link Fledgling Wings | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wings], but it is rather expensive to obtain Blue Bovine as a drawback.
