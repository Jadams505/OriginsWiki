				The <b>Defiled Watcher</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> that rarely spawns anywhere in the <a is="a-link">Defiled Wastelands</a>.
				The Defiled Watcher will randomly fly to various areas of where it spawns until after 14 seconds of not spotting the player.
				If the Watcher spots the player within this time frame, it will actively chase after the player and inflict <a is="a-link">Rasterized</a> at all times until it is killed.
				It won't try to make contact with the player, but it will get close enough to attack them with a flood of piercing light that deals substantial damage.
				Its attack will also prompt its <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health_regeneration">life regeneration</a> to trigger, even if it hasn't made contact with the player.
				Enemy spawn rates will also increase until the player or Watcher has been killed once a chase has started.

				<p>
					 - The beam of light the Watcher generates in search mode is the proximity in which it will spot the player.
					 The light goes through tiles, which also means it can see the player through tiles so long as they are in the light.

					 - The <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bestiary">Bestiary</a> entry for the Defiled Watcher: "The Watcher is a more direct way for the Defiled to look out for any foreign bodies that don't belong. Mainly, it's a way for the Defiled to prevent the its heart from being destroyed by the Terrarian."
