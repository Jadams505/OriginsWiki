				The <b>Area Denial</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link magic weapon | | Magic_Weapons.html] that is obtained through the [link Broken Record].
				It launches a probe to the targetted location the player selects on screen and explodes in 1-second intervals once it has stopped, dealing considerable damage and [link knockback | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Knockback] in a large blast radius.
				Only one probe can be active at a time and it can be blocked from its destination by tiles in the way, bouncing off of them.
				Once placed, the probe will remain for five minutes, similarly to the [link Crimson Rod | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Crimson_Rod].
			</p>

			<p>
				Its best [link modifier | | Modifiers.html] is <b>Demonic</b> or <b>Deadly</b> for damage output, and <b>Loaded</b> for its knockback and blast radius.
