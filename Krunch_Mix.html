					 - An inside joke of Krunch Mix, "A candy fair to the average white male child", was under consideration as a tooltip for some time but was changed.
					 The<br> context is that Krunch Mix resembles the Defiled in appearance and was referred as "Skittles for colorblind people" and the most colorblind group of<br> people statisically goes to white male children, hence the phrase.
