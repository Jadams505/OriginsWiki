					<p> - An inside joke of Krunch Mix, "A candy fair to the average white male child", was under consideration for some time but was changed. The context is that Krunch Mix resembles the Defiled in appearance and was referred as "Skittles for colorblind people" and the most colorblind group of people statisically goes to white male children, hence the phrase.</p>
