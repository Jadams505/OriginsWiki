			<p>
				The <b>Cleansing Station</b> is a functional [link furniture] item that is sold by the [link Dryad | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad] [link NPC | | NPCs.html] after completing her 'Woodsprite Steps' [link quest | | Quests.html].
				When holding down the <b>Interact</b> key nearby, it will rapidly deplete all [link Assimilation] the player has accrued.
				When holding a [link Mojo Flask] and interacting with the Cleansing Station, it will also refill it back to the five charges it started with.
				It is one of the three only sources of assimilation management currently available.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite being able to be placed in [link evil biomes], it will not cleanse the player or refill any Mojo Flasks while inside of it.
				The player must place the Cleansing Station far enough away from the evil biome in order to use it.
