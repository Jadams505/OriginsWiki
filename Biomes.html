			<h1>Biomes</h1>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<p>
				If you are looking for the official page of vanilla biomes, click <b>[link here | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Biomes]</b>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Biomes</b> are the different types of areas that any Terraria [link world | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/World] can contain.
				Every biome has its own characteristic terrain [link blocks], [link walls], collectible [link items | | Item_Index.html],<br> [link backgrounds | | Biome_Backgrounds.html], [link enemies], [link critters], [link music | | Origins_Music.html] themes, [link Angler | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Angler] [link quest fish] and other features.
			</p>

			<p>
				The [link Ashen | | Ashen_Factory.html], [link Defiled | | Defiled_Wastelands.html] and [link Riven | | Riven_Hive.html] are all "contagious" biomes which [link spread | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Biome_spread] to certain adjacent tiles.
				In [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode], the evil biomes will only overtake other<br> biomes via [link grasses | | Plants.html], [link ice | | Ice_Blocks.html], [link sand | | Sand_Blocks.html] and [link stone | | Stone_Blocks.html], but once [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] begins all three biomes can spread directly through most [link soils].
			</p>

			<h3>Space biomes</h3>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4>[link The Dawn | Images/themes/theme-dawn.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerDawn.png">
			<p>
				The Dawn is a planned post-[link Mech | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_bosses] [link sky | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Space] biome of holy themes.
				The Dawn is a sacred place that has physically manifested into the Terraria world so the angels<br> that watch after it can handle the current instability of the world with a more directly.
				Every entity that is not holy enough shall not enter the confines of the<br> Dawn, and will be met with "undesirable consequences" in the event that were to happen.
				The Dawn is here for no other purpose than to safeguard Terraria.
			</p>


			<h3>Surface biomes</h3>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4>[link Ashen Factory | Images/themes/theme-ashen.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerAshen.png">
			<p>
				The Ashen Factory is a planned third [link world evil | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Evil_biomes] added by Origins.
				The Factory is a machine that has created a robotic society beyond its intended purpose.<br>
				Not much is known as to how the Factory arrived to the Terraria world, but it is known to be a serious threat to life on the planet due to its<br> pollution-generating nature.
				The Ashen does not spread unlike the other four evils, but it can only be removed through demolition.
				As a matter of fact, it<br> offers the most content for [link Demolitionists | | Demolitionist_Weapons.html].
			</p>

			<h4>[link Brine Pool | Images/themes/theme-brine.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerBrine.png">
			<p>
				The Brine Pool is a natural hardmode mini-biome deep within the [link Jungle | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Jungle].
				It is a hostile environment and hard to enter due to its brine-rich waters, which will<br> overwhelm any unprotected entities that dare swim its waters.
				Ironically, it harbors a very diverse ecosystem based around the hydrothermal vents within its<br> hollow interior.
				It would of the Terrarian's interest to explore this biome early into hardmode, with proper protection of course.
			</p>

			<h4>[link Defiled Wastelands | Images/themes/theme-light.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerDefiled.png">
			<p>
				The Defiled Wastelands is the first world evil added by Origins.
				The Defiled is an ancient entity that was banished to the Dusk by the [link Dryad | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad] and her kin during<br> its infancy due to forseen consequences of letting it live.
				It was released from the Dusk after the [link Moon Lord | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon_Lord] attacked the inhabitants of Terraria and has been<br> rooting itself into the world ever since.
				It recognizes the Terrarian and attempts to counter them with its anti-bodies, constantly improving them and introducing<br> new forms in hopes of stopping the Terrarian in their tracks.
				However, it is an intelligent entity and it offers a unique, story-driven progression of its own.
				The<br> Defiled offers a lot of content to [link Mages | | Magic_Weapons.html].
			</p>

			<h4>[link Eutrophic Sea | Images/themes/theme-eutroph.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerEutroph.png">
			<p>
				The Eutrophic Sea is a unique archetype of the Riven Hive that has encompassed an [link Ocean | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ocean].
				The Eutrophic Sea is a horrifying sight to behold on the lands of Terraria as the Riven Hive is predominantly full of sub-aquatic species for when it gets flooded.
				When the Riven is able to reach an ocean, it spreads fast due to the salt and mass rich water, not only making it easier for it to synthesize [link Alkahest], but also providing it with more mass to use.
				Even if you made a boat out of glass, the viscosity of the gel wouldn't let you go anywhere.
			</p>

			<h4>[link Riven Hive | Images/themes/theme-riven.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerRiven.png">
			<p>
				The Riven Hive is the second world evil added by Origins.
				Don't let its beauty fool you for it is very easy to become one with the Hive's ecosystem.
				At base<br> level, the Riven Hive is just like any other environment, except that it was molded by an entity known as the "Primordial Amoeba".
				The Amoeba isn't inherently<br> evil, but it is sentient and rather selfish, forcing its hand, or rather flagella, to the world around it.
				The Riven Hive is a hostile biome where certain species have<br> evolved and even been born directly from its hot and humid caverns.
				The Riven offers the most content for [link Summoners | | Summon_Weapons.html] out of the five evils.
			</p>


			<h3>Cavern biomes</h3>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4>[link Defiled Caverns | Images/themes/theme-defiledcaverns.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerDefiledCaverns.png">
			<p>
				The Defiled Caverns is created in the [link Cavern | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Cavern] layer upon defeating the [link Wall of Flesh | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wall_of_Flesh].
				The presence of the Defiled Caverns is a terrible sign that the Defiled is<br> making rapid progress to consuming the entire world and must be stopped immediately.
				Like the other underground evil biomes, it is one of the only places to<br> obtain [link Souls of Night | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Soul_of_Night], but not its [link evil substance | | Recipes.html]: [link Black Bile].
				Uniquely, the Defiled Caverns' [link theme | | Origins_Music.html] can be heard in pre-hardmode at the appropriate depth.
			</p>

			<h4>[link Fiberglass Caves | Images/themes/theme-fiberglass.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerFiberglass.png">
			<p>
				The Fiberglass Caves are a natural Cavern biome located directly under the Brine Pool in the [link Underground Jungle | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Underground_Jungle].
				The Caves are full of of enchanted<br> elemental spawn that safeguard the biome from any intruders.
				Deeper with, however, resides the colossal [link Fiberglass Weaver] spider that will also protect its<br> home.
			</p>

			<h3>Hell biomes</h3>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4>[link The Dusk | Images/themes/theme-dusk.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerDusk.png">
			<p>
				The Dusk is a hardmode [link Hell | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Underworld] biome that serves as a purgatory for Terraria's worst offenders.
				Contrary to the underworld surrounding it, the Dusk is actually of<br> lukewarm temperature making it more hospitable but this is because of the illuminant vortex at its center.
				The Dusk is bastioned by the clockwork machinations<br> built to watch after the criminal denizens banished to its confines, and, in the event that they attempted escape, they would be sent through the aforementioned<br> vortex, never to return.
				The Dusk is ultimately the other safeguard established by the world itself to maintain it like its holy-equivalent, the Dawn.
			</p>


			<h3>[link The Cosmos] biomes</h3>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4>[link Fractured Isles | Images/themes/theme-fracturedisles.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerFractured.png">
			<p>
				The Fractured Isles are a planned post-Moon Lord biome residing within the Cosmos dimension.
				The Isles was once a part of a planet home to an alien<br> civilization that collapsed by unknown cause.
				There are artificial structures on the the isles that remain the test of time to serve as some kind of ceremonial<br> grounds for their long lost and to-be warriors.
			</p>


			<h3>Structures</h3>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<h4>[link Cubekon Temple | Images/themes/theme-qube.png]</h4>
			<img src="Images/BiomeBannerQube.png">
			<p>
				The Cubekon Temple is a post-[link Moon Lord | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Moon_Lord] temple-like structure generally found adjacent to [link Marble Caves | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Marble_Cave].
				The Temple is very blocky and modular by design<br> despite being carved out of [link Batholith], a very tough type of rock.
				Within the temple, resides one of the most technologically-advanced species known to Terraria<br> and they don't take welcome to any intruders.
				The temple is only accessible to those of its own kind, measured by the amount of energy within their vessels, but<br> that ultimately means its accessible to any entity able to wield such power like the Terrarian.
				The Cubekons are always curious to learn more, but currently they<br> have been working towards obtaining their own version of the singularity.
