			<p>
				<b>Rasterized</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="Debuffs.html">debuff</a> that is applied by most items and enemies found in the <a is="a-link">Defiled Wastelands</a>.
				When applied to an NPC, they will be <a is="a-link" href="Stun.html">stunned</a> for a duration based on the source while taking on a light gray hue.
				When applied to a player, they will instead have their movement speed reduced in all directions and movement-related inputs delayed while taking on the same light gray hue but with a glitchy effect depending on how fast they move.
