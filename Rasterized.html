			<p>
				<b>Rasterized</b> is a [link debuff | | Debuffs.html] that is applied by most items and enemies found in the [link Defiled Wastelands].
				When applied to an NPC, they will be [link stunned | | Stun.html] for a duration based on the source while taking on a light gray hue.
				When applied to a player, they will instead have their movement speed reduced in all directions and movement-related inputs delayed while taking on the same light gray hue but with a glitchy effect depending on how fast they move.
