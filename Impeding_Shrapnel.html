			<p>
				<b>Impeding Shrapnel</b> is a [link debuff | | Debuffs.html] that is applied by most items and enemies found in the [link Ashen Factory].
				When applied to an NPC that is slain afterwards, the enemy will release 5-7 frenzied shrapnel where it died that also inflict Impeding Shrapnel and deal damage.
				When applied to a player, they will instead be instantly killed if at or below 20% of their max [link life | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health], however, if the player is above that threshold they will instead be inflicted with [link Bleeding | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bleeding].
