				The <b>Protomind</b> is a [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] [link accessory | | Accessories.html] combining a [link Brain of Confusion | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Brain_of_Confusion] with the [link Potato Battery].
				When equipped, enemies have a 3/5 (60%) chance of receiving the [link Confused | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Confused] [link debuff | | Debuffs.html] for a minimum of 1.5 seconds.
				The chance, duration, and area of effect of the debuff are based on the amount of damage taken.
				Additionally, all magic projectiles home towards enemies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Furthermore, the player wielding it has a 1/6 (16.67%) chance of dodging an attack, which inflicts the [link Cerebral Mindtrick | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Brain_of_Confusion] debuff on them for 4 seconds.
				Despite being a debuff, it increases [link critical strike | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Critical_hit] chance and [link summon damage | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage#Summon] by 10%.
				While the debuff is active, the player cannot dodge another attack.
