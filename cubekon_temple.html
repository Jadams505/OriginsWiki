		<h1>Cubekon Temple - Lore</h1>
		<p> - The Cubekon Temple is one of the added artificial structures in Terraria Origins. The temple can be best described as a tomb that was earthed long ago due<br>
 		rectangular anatomy consistent with their naming conventions. The Cuboids are an entirely mechanical alien race that ultimately seek out the mass collection<br>
		of information throughout the universe. They are not known to be hostile unless when a foreign entity has entered their premises, the Cubekon Temple. In this<br>
		case, the temple is locked behind a giant gate that requires an entity to possess an incredible amount of energy in order to open. No entity can break through<br>
		the temple through any means, but in the event that they could, the temple's inhabitants would surely destroy said intruder.
		
		Simply put, any entity without enough energy (of any kind) in their possession will not be admitted into the temple, but any entity that is not Cubekon in origin will be destroyed.
