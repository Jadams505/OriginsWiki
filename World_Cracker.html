				The <b>World Cracker</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a>, <a is="a-link" href="Riven_Hive.html">Riven</a>-themed <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Worm_AI">worm</a> <a is="a-link" href="Bosses.html">boss</a>.
				It is summoned when three <a is="a-link" href="Gel_Blister.html">Gel Blisters</a> are destroyed in a Riven world, or when a player uses <a is="a-link">Suspicious Looking Ice Cream</a> anywhere in the Riven Hive or <a is="a-link">Underground Riven Hive</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The World Cracker has a very simple behavior, however, it has a few quirks that make it challenging in of itself.
				It has a total of 19 segments in all difficulties including the head and tail, and it all counts as one unlike the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eater_of_Worlds">Eater of Worlds</a>.
				It will circle around the player and move to the opposite direction of the player making it unpredictable.
				While moving around it will shoot an amoeba bubble from any one of its segments that deals high damage.
				Furthermore, the World Cracker has armor on all of its segments that reduce damage until it is destroyed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Defeating the World Cracker and destroying its armor are the only ways of obtaining <a is="a-link" href="Undead_Chunk.html">Undead Chunks</a>, and are one of the ways of obtaining usable quantities of <a is="a-link">Encrusted Ore</a> alongside the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a>.
				Defeating the World Cracker for the first time also allows the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Tavernkeep">Tavernkeep</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a> to spawn as the Unconcious Man, and allows <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteorite_(biome)">meteorites</a> to land.

						As previously stated, the World Cracker's behavior is simple.
						It behaves like most worms except that it prefers to attack in vertical strikes and moves opposite of the player.
						If the player doesn't move, it will instead go for a direct strike.
						It will also shoot an amoeba bubble at the player from any of its segments every .84 to 1.17s.
