					- Hello my name on the internet is "chee" and I'm an aspiring freelance video game developer working with the Origins Team to fulfill our dreams together.<br>
					I come from a background as a gamer enjoying a lot of different games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechAssault">Mechassault</a> (my favorite game of all time).
					The idea of Origins came up in<br> my mind back in 2016 and at the time it was just an idea with a couple of early rendition sprites of some things in the mod.
					I eventually met my best friend<br> Tyftyer (was known as Terlet Paper at the time) that same year and it eventually came to the topic of how cool Terraria is, which transformed into us<br> beginning our partnership.
					For the following three years, we were just planning the mod and let it sit in the background, but around 2020 we started making<br> progress as we saw the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/1.4.0.1">Journey's End</a> update had been coming around and that official TModLoader support would be brought into Steam.
					We've been very<br> dedicated to the mod ever since, but I've personally been quite seaonal with my progress (my work ethic involves me taking big breaks because I cram a lot<br> into a short time span).
					WIP...
