			<p>
				<b>Moonshines</b> are large plants which can be found growing naturally in [link the Dusk], and can be broken with a [link pickaxe | | Pickaxes.html] or [link drill | | Drills.html], or by coming into contact with [link water | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Water].
				They cannot be grown from [link seeds | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Seeds] like most other plants, but are instead placed fully-grown, either naturally upon world generation or by the player.
				They provide the <b>Empowered</b> [link buff | | Buffs.html] to players, [link enemies], and [link NPCs] within a rectangular area of 10x12 tiles centered on the Moonshine, which heals for 2% of max [link life | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health] every second, and a 15% increase in enemy [link spawn rates | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/NPC_spawning#Spawn_rates] for players.
			</p>

			<p>
				Moonshine can be placed on any [link blocks], unlike [link Sunflowers | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Sunflower].
