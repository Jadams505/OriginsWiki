				The <b>Pustule Jellyfish</b> is an [link enemy | | Enemies.html] that commonly appears in the [link Eutrophic Sea].
				It behaves similarly to normal [link Jellyfish | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Jellyfish], except that it will now kamikaze into the player to explode and deal significant damage to the player.
				It will turn into an alternate version of itself after exploding and continue to pursue the player, but cannot explode its pustule anymore.
