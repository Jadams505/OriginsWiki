				<b>Armor</b> is a set of equipable items that reduce damage taken from [link enemies] and most other damage sources.
				Armor pieces are equipped by placing them in the armor slots of the player's [link inventory | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory].
				Armor can also be placed in [link vanity slots | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory#Vanity_armor_(3_slots)] to change the player's appearance without affecting stats.
				Armor pieces are either [link crafted | | Recipes.html], purchased from [link NPCs], or dropped from enemies.
				Each armor set is generally based around the [link damage types | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage#Damage_types] introduced in the vanilla game as well as in Origins, however, Origins adds a couple that provide [link generic | | Generic_Damage.html] bonuses that apply to all classes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Every piece of armor provides [link defense | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense] that reduces damage by half its value in [link Classic Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Classic_Mode], three-quarters in [link Expert | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode], and all of it rounded up in [link Master | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode].
				In addition to the defense provided by individual armor pieces, most armor types provide a <b>Set Bonus</b> when all three pieces of the same armor type are worn simultaneously.
				More advanced or unique armors can provide other specialized set bonuses.

				<p>
					 - Some armor pieces provide [link generic | | Generic_Damage.html] boosts, which can benefit hybridized/mixed playstyles.
					 Origins invests into the generic damage type to promote more diverse gameplay.
					 Despite the presence of generic boosts, they are often very scarce since they benefit every damage type.
