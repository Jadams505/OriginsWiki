			<h1>Changes to Vanilla Content</h1>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<div id="table-of-contents"></div>

			<p>
				Origins makes some changes to pre-existing content in order to add more options, encourage a natural progression of added Origins content and to improve sensibility with the lore.
				These changes may also touch up on the rather neglected areas of Terraria for further diversity.
				It is additionally worth noting that more changes may be implemented or removed in the future as issues are addressed and when necessary for further development.

				<summary>Equipment<span class="divider"></span></summary>

				<p>
					Advanced weapon functionality in PVP - Weapons and accessories with homing and other proximity effects (like that of [link Magic Tripwire]) now work properly in [link PVP | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer#PvP_and_teams].
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>[link Explosive | | Demolitionist_Weapons.html] damage type</b> - In order to make the Demolitionist class, all of the weapons that were considered explosives in vanilla Terraria have been reclassified under the Explosive damage type.
					Few vanilla weapons still classify as [link Ranged | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ranged_weapons] while also classifying as an explosive.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>[link Harpoon | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Harpoon]</b> - With interest of a new [link ranged | | Ranged_Weapons.html] sub-class idea, we wanted to change the fundamental characteristics of the Harpoon weapon.
					So, we instead turned the Harpoon weapon into a consumable item that acted as [link ammunition] for [link harpoon guns].
					Here is the new [link Harpoon] entry.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>[link Proximity Mine Launcher | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Proximity_Mine_Launcher]</b> - With the introduction of the [link Resizable Mines], we thought it would make more sense if the Proximity Mine Launcher used them as ammo alongside [link rockets | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Rockets].
					Rockets can still be used as we didn't want to remove any previous functionality of the Proximity Mine Launcher.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>[link Royal Gel | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Royal_Gel]</b> - To match items like [link Strange Tooth] and [link Protozoa Food], Royal Gel now summons a slime [link minion | | Minions.html] to fight for the player, which counts as [link summon damage | | Summon_Weapons.html] and thus benefits from any summon-related bonuses.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>[link Volatile Gelatin | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Volatile_Gelatin]</b> - In order to make Volatile Gelatin more useful and match the bonuses we've given our own [link accessories] like [link Speed Booster], this item's attack now benefits from damage bonuses provided by the [link Wrath Potion | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wrath_Potion] or any other accessories.
					Furthermore, it is now considered for [link explosive damage | | Demolitionist_Weapons.html] and allows the player's hits to coat enemies in slime that eventually explodes.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Wood Ebonwood, Shadewood, and Pearlwood armors</b> - [link Ebonwood | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ebonwood_armor], [link Shadewood | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Shadewood_armor], and [link Pearlwood armor | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pearlwood_armor] have received boosts to their [link defense | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense] values.
					Ebonwood and Shadewood both having 2 in their helmets, and 3 in their breastplates and greaves (8 total).
					Pearlwood has 6 in the helmet and greaves, and 7 in the breastplate (19 total).

				<p>
					<b>[link Trees | | Blocks.html]</b> - All trees (except for [link gem trees | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Trees#Gem_trees]) now drop [link Bark] and [link Tree Sap], which both can be used to craft [link Rubber].
					Tree Sap can additionally be used to craft some [link food | | Food.html]
					items.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details class="section" id="Entities" open>
				<summary>Entities<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					<b>[link Bats | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bats]</b> - All bats now drop the [link Bat Hide] material, which can be crafted into [link Leather | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Leather].
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>
					<b>[link Demolitionist | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Demolitionist]</b> - The Demolitionist now sells [link Explosive Powder | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Explosive_Powder] at anytime rather than solely in [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode].
					It does not interfere with the obtainability of [link Exploding Bullets | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Exploding_Bullet] and the change allows for more [link explosive weapons | | Demolitionist_Weapons.html] to be crafted.
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>
					<b>[link Eater of Worlds | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eater_of_Worlds]</b> - With the addition of the [link Demolitionist weapons], it was necessary to reduce the damage reduction given to the Eater of Worlds in [link Expert Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode]
					to explosives.
					The Eater of Worlds' damage reduction is reduced to 50% in Expert Mode and remains at 80% in [link Master Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode].
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>
					<b>Boss Immunities</b> - The [link stun] mechanics provided by vanilla's [link Heart Arrows | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Heart_Arrow], and Origins' [link Rasterized] and [link Toxic Shock] debuffs, we felt it was proper to give every [link boss | | Bosses.html] a strong resistance against this mechanic entirely for balancing reasons.
					In most cases, it is entirely possible to stun-lock certain bosses and artificially remove all difficulty provided with avoiding their attacks.
					With the right set-up, however, it is still possible to stun-lock some enemies in the game.
