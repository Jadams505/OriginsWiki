			<h1>Changes to Vanilla Content</h1>
			<div class="divider"></div>

			<div id="table-of-contents"></div>

			<p>
				Origins makes some changes to pre-existing content in order to add more options, encourage a natural progression of added Origins content and<br> to improve sensibility with the lore.
				These changes may also touch up on the rather neglected areas of Terraria for further diversity.
				It is additionally<br> worth noting that more changes may be implemented or removed in the future as issues are addressed and when necessary for further development.

				<p>
					<b>[link Harpoon | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Harpoon]</b> - With interest of a new [link ranged | | Ranged_Weapons.html] sub-class idea, we wanted to change the fundamental characteristics of the Harpoon weapon.
					So, we instead turned the<br> Harpoon weapon into a consumable item that acted as [link ammunition] for [link harpoon guns].
					Here is the new [link Harpoon] entry.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>[link Proximity Mine Launcher | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Proximity_Mine_Launcher]</b> - With the introduction of the [link Resizable Mines], we thought it would make more sense if the Proximity Mine Launcher used them as<br> ammo instead of [link rockets | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Rockets].
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Wood Ebonwood, Shadewood, and Pearlwood armors</b> - [link Ebonwood | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ebonwood_armor], [link Shadewood | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Shadewood_armor], and [link Pearlwood armor | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pearlwood_armor] have received boosts to their [link defense | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense] values.
					Ebonwood and Shadewood both having 2 in their helmets, and 3 in their breastplates and greaves (8 total).
					Pearlwood has 6 in the helmet and greaves, and 7 in the breastplate (19 total).

				<p>
					<b>[link Trees | | Plants.html]</b> - All trees now drop [link Bark] and [link Tree Sap], which both can be used to craft [link Rubber].
					Tree Sap can additionally be used to craft some [link food | | Food.html]<br>
					items.

				<p>
					<b>[link Bats | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bats]</b> - All bats now drop the [link Bat Hide] material, which can be crafted into [link Leather | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Leather].
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>
					<b>[link Demolitionist | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Demolitionist]</b> - The Demolitionist now sells [link Explosive Powder | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Explosive_Powder] at anytime rather than solely in [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode].
					It does not interfere with the obtainability of<br> [link Exploding Bullets | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Exploding_Bullet] and the change allows for more [link explosive weapons | | Demolitionist_Weapons.html] to be crafted.
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>
					<b>[link Eater of Worlds | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eater_of_Worlds]</b> - With the addition of the [link Demolitionist weapons], it was necessary to reduce the damage reduction given to the Eater of Worlds in [link Expert Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode]<br>
					to explosives.
					The Eater of Worlds' damage reduction is reduced to 50% in Expert Mode and remains at 80% in [link Master Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode].
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<p>
					<b>Boss Immunities</b> - The [link stun] mechanics provided by vanilla's [link Heart Arrows | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Heart_Arrow], and Origins' [link Rasterized] and [link Toxic Shock] debuffs, we felt it was proper to give every<br> [link boss | | Bosses.html] immunity to this mechanic entirely for balancing reasons.
