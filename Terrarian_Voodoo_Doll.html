				The <b>Terrarian Voodoo Doll</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link accessory | | Accessories.html] that is obtained by the [link Treasure Bag | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Treasure_Bag] dropped by [link Skeletron | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Skeletron] in [link Master Mode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode].
				While equipped, the player's [link pickup range | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Items#Pickup] is increased.
				The dropped item also counts as wherever the player is located, meaning that if the doll is thrown in [link water | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Water] it will count the player as in water at all times until moved.
				The item can additionally pick up items, [link Hearts | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Heart] and [link Stars | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Star] with a slightly smaller range than the player, however, its own range is affected by any pickup range boosts as well.
