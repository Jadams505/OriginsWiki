			<h2>The Mod</h2>
			<p> - Terraria Origins is a (planned) large content mod that seeks out to give Terraria a sensible origin story to the game in tandem with previously given<br>
			lore availible. Terraria Origins adds a variety of content throughout the entirety of the playthrough including five new [link Biomes] and three structures, an<br>
			explosive-based [link Demolitionist] class, twenty-eight [link songs] for the new bosses and biomes, and eight [link changes] to vanilla content, and more!</p>
			<p><b>***If you have questions about the wiki, it would be best to discuss it on the official discord.</b></p>
