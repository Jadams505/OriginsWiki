			<p>The <b>Mutualism</b> mechanic as of now only applies to the Mimic-Defiled Spread gimmick that is vital to the [link Mimic Armor] playstyle. Mutualism is the mechanic that<br>
			allows the player to grow with the [link Defiled Wastelands] meaning the spread of the Defiled in the world has a direct boost on the player as well. More about the<br>
			Mutualism mechanic can be explained in the [link Mimic Armor] page.</p>
