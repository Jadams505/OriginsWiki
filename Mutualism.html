			<h1>Mutualism</h1>
			<p>The <b>Mutualism</b> mechanic as of now only applies to the Mimic-Defiled Spread gimmick that is vital to the [link Mimic Armor] playstyle. Mutualism is the mechanic that allows the player to grow with the [link Defiled Wastelands] meaning the spread of the Defiled in the world has a<br>
