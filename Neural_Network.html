				The <b>Neural Network</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link gun | | Guns.html] that is currently obtained through the [link Broken Record] or craftable using [link Sanguinite Bars | | Sanguinite_Bar.html] and [link NE-8 | | NE_8.html].
				The Neural Network inflicts a [link buff | | Buffs.html] to the player that causes its fire rate to increase after every consecutive hit.
				The buff will disappear after the player misses one of their shots from this weapon, but will not disappear if the player swaps to another weapon.
				Its icon can also be right-clicked in order to remove it, if the player desires to for whatever reason.
				Neural Network's base damage is lowered for every stack of the buff in order to offset its fire rate, however, it will always deal higher overall DPS with its faster fire rate.
