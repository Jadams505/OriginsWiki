			<h1>Brine Pool</h1>
			<div class="divider"></div>
			<p><i>"No brew I know rivals the Brine. Maybe I should steal some later."</i> - The <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Witch_Doctor">Witch Doctor</a></p>

			<div id="table-of-contents"></div>

			<p>The <b>Brine Pool</b> is an aquatic <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> mini-biome (similar to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteorite_(biome)">Meteorite crash site</a>) That features a diversity of many enemies fitting<br>
			in with the acidic theme. The Brine Pool always spawns within or adjacent to a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Jungle">Jungle</a> biome. It is very easy to identify with the presence<br>
			of [link Peat Moss] along a large lake with [link Sulphur Stone] also visible from the top. The Pool is very deep and hard to escape from without<br>
			<a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Flipper">Flippers</a> or other swimming gear. The Brine Pool does not inherently put the player in anymore danger than they would be being inside the Jungle until<br>
			having dove deep enough. The deeper into the Brine Pool the player goes, the more likely enemies are to spawn. Not to mention that enemies in the Brine<br>
			Pool are leveled to Hardmode stats making it increasingly difficult to deal with enemies. Besides the enemies present, the Brine Pool also has a brine cloud<br>
			that appears towards the bottom area of the biome, which inflicts '[link Toxic Shock]' to anything that hasn't adapted to the harsh conditions.
			<div>
			It is also worth noting that there are some anti-cheat mechanisms set in place to prevent the player from using exploits to break intended progression through<br>
			the biome. One of the mechanisms is known as "[link Anoxic Air]" which makes it to where if the player artificially makes an airpocket the air will not be breathable<br>
			as it is not connected to an air source. Anoxic Air <i>does not</i> fully restrict the player from utilizing tiles to get air, it just makes it just as tedious as acquiring the<br>
			equipment needed explore the Brine Pool. The other mechanism is known as "[link Sulphuric Absorption]", which basically makes Sulphur Stone impervious to<br>
				explosives.</p>

				<p> - It is worth noting that spikes in the Defiled Wastelands are generated with the world and cannot grow on clentaminated land.<br>
				- The [link Defiled Amalgamation] will only spawn when the player is standing on the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Layers">surface</a> of the world.<br>
				- The Defiled can be manually spread by using [link Defiled Seeds | $default | Defiled_Seed.html], [link Defiled Powder], [link White Water], or the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Clentaminator">Clentaminator</a> with [link White Solution], obtainable from the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Steampunker">Steampunker</a> during a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Moon">Blood Moon</a> in Crimson worlds.</p>

				<p> - When navigating the Defiled Wastelands bring a lot of bombs and torches as it gets really dark at night in the wastelands and bombs for blowing a hole<br>
				through spikes in the way.</p>

				<p> - The Defiled was originally planned to have something to do with corrupted code, but for the namesake and consistency of the mod, it was later changed to<br>
				better fit the feel of Terraria.
				<p> - When the Defiled Wastelands is in the world, the indicator during world generation will be white and green and the other will be black to resemble the only<br>
				two prominent colors in the Defiled.</p>
				<p> - The Defiled Caverns represents some kind of circulatory system to hint at what the Defiled might actually be.</p>

				<p><h1>The Defiled</h1>
				<p>The Defiled Wastelands was an entity unleashed when the [link Dusk] lost control of the dark forces of Terraria causing an imbalance. Ever since its freedom, it has<br>
				taken form onto the landscape of the Terraria world and used it as a way to grow. The Defiled has had enough time to have a sizeable hold on the landscape<br>
				and even take control of the life present on Terraria. The Defiled is not a place, it is a living being, and it is intelligent too. The Defiled creatures the Terrarian<br>
				faces are merely its immune system and work force. The Defiled being creates these machinations using the nervous system of the original host for control<br>
				and chunks made of Defiled matter to construct them from the ground up. These machinations are held together and move around with the use of Defiled<br>
				spirits, which act as a force and glue that binds it all together.
				<div>
				The Defiled is guided by no motive, it is just a being of pure dark energy that just wants to survive, and it will do <i>anything</i> to do so. It serves as a threat to<br>
				the Terraria world and acts as a parasite, feeding off of it. As soon as the Defiled had grown large enough, the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> was alerted of its prescense. The Dryad<br>
				has a lot to say about the Defiled and even mentions how her fellow kin have struggled to contain it and banish it to the [link Dusk] after much effort. The Defiled<br>
				is so resistant to the purity that attempting to purify it is ultimately futile without hindering it. It also has become more powerful ever since it was released<br>
				from the Dusk according to the Dryad's history.</p>
