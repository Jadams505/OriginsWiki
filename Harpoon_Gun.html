				The <b>Harpoon Gun</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link weapon | | Weapons.html] that has a 1/200 (0.5%) chance of being dropped by most enemies during a [link Goblin Army | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Goblin_Army].
				It is functionally the same as the vanilla [link Harpoon | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Harpoon] it replaces except that it now requires [link harpoons] for [link ammunition].
				The harpoon gun and weapons like it have a small chance of a line and harpoon being lost when colliding with a tile or enemy.

				Its best [link modifier | | Modifiers.html] is <b>Godly</b> or <b>Demonic</b>.
