				The <b>Potato Launcher</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] [link generic weapon | | Generic_Damage.html] that is sold by the [link Cubekon Tinkerer] [link NPC | | NPCs.html] at all times.
				It uses [link Potatoes | | Potato.html] as [link ammunition] and simply fires them in an arc.
				The [link Potato Battery] counts as a source of ammo for this weapon, and will not be consumed on use, however, using the Potato Battery as ammo dramatically increases the [link attack speed | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Attack_speed] of this weapon and makes all of its shots home in on enemies.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Its best [link modifier | | Modifiers.html] is <b>Legendary</b>.
