				The <b>Defiled Heart</b> is the key to properly cleansing the [link Defiled | | Defiled_Wastelands.html] from the world.
				Once a world enters [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode], they can be destroyed with any [link hammer | | Hammers.html] that has 80% or higher hammer power.
				Hitting them with a hammer otherwise causes the player to lose half their [link health | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health] and leave the heart unaffected.

				<p>
					 - Once all Defiled Hearts in the world are destroyed, the Defiled will not spread at all unless when spread artificially.<br>
					 - Defiled enemies will no longer regenerate health.
					 - The "Mimic Route" progression exclusive to Defiled worlds can no longer be achieved.
				</p>

				<summary>Messages and Behavior<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					Messages will only appear on the last Defiled Heart.
					The [link status messages | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Status_messages] below will appear as the Defiled Heart is struck:
				</p>
				<p>
					 - First hit: "The walls rumble around you..."<br>
					 - Second hit: "Chorus!d scre@ms boom in %he c^verns..."<br>
					 - Third hit: "T*e Hear7 vibra#e$ i@tensely..."<br>
					 - Fourth hit: "$t-st0p. 9le@se..."<br>
					 - Fifth hit: "Let me l!ve and I h3lp..."<br>
					 - Sixth hit: "The Defiled begins to wither..."
				</p>
				<p>
					These messages will appear if the player doesn't hit the Defiled Heart a 6th time:
				</p>
				<p>
					 - 5 seconds after: "T&ank you, [player name]. I was ex9ecting to die."<br>
					 - 7 seconds after: "I see you as a friend..."<br>
					 - 9 seconds after: "Do you trust me..?"
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point, the '[link Defiled Protector]' [link buff | | Buffs.html] will be permanently applied to the player making Defiled enemies friendly and providing various boosts when in any Defiled [link biome | | Biomes.html] until the last Defiled Heart has been destroyed.
					This opens up an entirely new path for progression in the game: the "Mimic Route".
					The [link Defiled Effigy] [link NPC | | NPCs.html] will now be allowed to move in with the player as well.

				<p>
					The Defiled Heart serves as the central working center for the Defiled, communicating information, generating chunks and using oxygen for energy production.
					The Defiled Heart uses up oxygen and gathered dark spirits to keep the Defiled going and growing eventually expelling out a pollutant that absorbs light in a way to make the world appear desaturated of color.
					Defiled Fissures contribute by communicating with the Heart about any activity reported by nearby Defiled creatures by sending the information with a nerve impulse signal, which travels along Defiled matter as dark magic.
					<div>
					Defiled Fissures also release and send Defiled spirits to paste to existing and future Defiled machinations for construction and repair.
