			<p>The <b>Defiled Heart</b> is a floating collection of Defiled matter around a central, Defiled spirit. The Heart can be found deep in the [link Defiled Caverns] at the center of the all the veins it connects to. It is protected by 2 thick layers of [link Defiled Stone] which revolve around it in a spherical manner. Detroying the Heart is neccessary to stop the Defiled from spreading <i>entirely</i>, but cannot be destroyed until after defeating the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_bosses">mechanical bosses</a>.</p>

				<p>
					- Once all Defiled Hearts in the world are destroyed, the Defiled will not spread at all unless when spread artificially.<br />
					- Defiled enemies will no longer regenerate health.

				<p>Messages will only apply to the last Defiled Heart. The <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Status_messages">status messages</a> below will appear as the Defiled Heart is struck:</p>
				<p>
					- First hit: "The w#alls rumble around you..."<br />
					- Second hit: "Chorus!d scre@ms boom in %he c^verns..."<br>
					- Third hit: "T*e Hear7 vibra#e$ i@tensely..."<br />
					- Fourth hit: "$t-st0p. 9le@se..."<br>
					- Fifth hit: "Let me l!ve and I h3lp..."<br>
					- Sixth hit: "The Defiled begins to wither..."
				</p>
				<p>These messages will appear if the player doesn't hit the Defiled Heart a 6th time:</p>
				<p>
					- 5 seconds after: "T&ank you, [player name]. I was ex9ecting to die."<br>
					- 8 seconds after: "I see you as a friend..."<br />
					- 9 seconds after: "Have my blessing..."
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point, the Defiled Heart will drop the [link Mimic Armor] set for the player to use. Addtionally, '[link Defiled Protector]' will be permanently applied to the player<br>
					making Defiled enemies friendly and providing various boosts when in the [link Defiled Wastelands] until the last Defiled Heart has been destroyed. This opens up an<br>
					entirely new path for progression in the game. The [link Defiled Envoy] will now be allowed to move in with the player as well.

				<p><h1>The Defiled Heart and Fissures</h1>
				<p>
					The Defiled Heart serves as the central working center for the Defiled, communicating information, generating chunks, and using oxygen for energy production.<br>
					The Defiled Heart uses up oxygen and gathered dark spirits to keep the Defiled going and growing eventually expelling out a pollutant that absorbs light in a way<br>
					to make the world appear desaturated of color. Defiled Fissures contribute by communicating with the Heart about any activity reported by nearby Defiled creatures<br>
					by sending the information with a nerve impulse signal, which travels along Defiled matter as dark magic.
					<div>
					Defiled Fissures also release and send Defiled spirits to paste to existing and future Defiled machinations for construction and repair.
