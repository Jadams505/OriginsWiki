			<p><i>"The antithesis of any god, a society of which possesses god-like qualities through the establishment of its technology."</i></p>
			<p> - The Cubekon Temple is an artificial, temple-like structure added in Terraria Origins. It is a <a href="Post_ML_Content.html"><b>Post-Moon Lord</b></a> biome that contains a fair amount of end-game<br>
			crafting materials, 3 unique enemies, an unlockable <a href="Town_NPCs.html"><b>Town NPC</b></a>, and many equipment. The temple is very difficult to navigate as enemies will attempt to prevent the<br>
			player from navigating further into it. It can be usually located adjacent to <a href="https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Marble_Caves"><b>Marble Caves</b></a> and is comprised of <a href="Batholith.html"><b>Batholith</b></a>, a durable and ancient rocky material.<br>
			Traversal through the temple will prove to be very difficult with the numerous traps and enemies that are housed within as well as the ambient conditions that are<br>
			present without proper equipment.</p>

				<summary>Notes</summary>
				<p> - The Cubekon Temple will always generate adjacent to any <a href="https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Marble_Caves"><b>Marble Cave</b></a>.</p>
				<p> - A player is considered to be in the Cubekon Temple when surrounded by a minimum of 200 <a href="Batholith.html"><b>Batholith</b></a>.</p>
				<p> - The player will be affected by the '<a href="Ionizing_Radiation.html"><b>Ionizing Radiation</b></a>' debuff as soon as they enter the Cubekon Temple, making it unsafe to travel long into the temple without<br>
				protection. Wearing fully-equipped <a href="https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Lead_armor?so=search"><b>Lead Armor</b></a> can reduce the effects of '<a href="Ionizing_Radiation.html"><b>Ionizing Radiation</b></a>' making the total time the player has to explore longer.</p>
				<p> - The Cubekon Temple's gate will open once the player has defeated '<a href="https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Lord?so=search"><b>Moon Lord</b></a>', which is indicated by the message "The ground rumbles from a giant hiss below...".</p>

				<p><h1>Cuboids and the Cubekon Temple</h1>
				<p> - The temple can be best described as a tomb that was earthed long ago due to the catastrophic events that occured in Terraria's past. The temple's inhabitants,<br>
				known as the 'Cuboids' adopt a rectangular anatomy consistent with their naming conventions. The Cuboids are an entirely mechanical alien race that ultimately seek<br>
				out the mass collection of information throughout the universe. They are not known to be hostile unless when a foreign entity has entered their premises, the<br>
				Cubekon Temple. In this case, the temple is locked behind a giant gate that requires an entity to possess an incredible amount of energy in order to open. No<br>
				entity can break through the temple through any means, but in the event that they could, the temple's inhabitants would surely destroy said intruder. Simply put,<br>
				any entity without enough energy (of any kind) in their possession will not be admitted into the temple, but any entity that is not Cubekon in origin will be<br>
				destroyed.</p>
				<p> - But... why would the Cubekons want to keep out any intruders if their core goal was to learn more about Terraria? It is because the Cuboids are<br>
				<i>protecting something...</i></p>
				<p> - The Cuboids seem to be a more advanced civilization beyond the capabilities of the Lihzard and Martians alike. Their final technological goal is their<br>
				eventual transformation into a singularity, namely <a href="Quantux.html"><b>Quantux</b></a>. <a href="Quantux.html"><b>Quantux</b></a> is the final collection of all information the Cuboids' have gathered, however,<br>
				<a href="Quantux.html"><b>Quantux</b></a> is still in an incomplete state due to the lack of materials and energy necessary to complete it. Due to this, <a href="Quantux.html"><b>Quantux</b></a> is in a weakened state<br>
				and cannot function properly.</p></p>
