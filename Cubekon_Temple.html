			<p>The <b>Cubekon Temple</b> is an artificial, temple-like structure added in Terraria Origins. It is a <a href="Post_ML_Content.html"><b>Post-Moon Lord</b></a> biome that contains a fair amount
			of end-game crafting materials, 3 unique enemies, an unlockable <a href="Town_NPCs.html"><b>Town NPC</b></a>, and much equipment. The temple is very difficult to navigate as
			enemies will attempt to prevent the player from navigating further into it. It can be usually located adjacent to <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Marble_Caves"><b>Marble Caves</b></a> and is comprised of <a is="a-link">Batholith</a>, a
			durable and ancient rocky material. Traversal through the temple will prove to be very difficult with the numerous enemies that are housed within as well as the
			ambient conditions that are present without proper equipment.</p>

				<p><h1>Cuboids and the Cubekon Temple</h1>
				<p>The temple can be best described as a tomb that was earthed long ago due to the catastrophic events that occured in Terraria's past. The temple's inhabitants,
				known as the 'Cuboids' adopt a rectangular anatomy consistent with their naming conventions. The Cuboids are an entirely mechanical alien race that ultimately seek
				out the mass collection of information throughout the universe. They are not known to be hostile unless when a foreign entity has entered their premises, the
				Cubekon Temple. In this case, the temple is locked behind a giant gate that requires an entity to possess an incredible amount of energy in order to open. No
				entity can break through the temple through any means, but in the event that they could, the temple's inhabitants would surely destroy said intruder. Simply put,
				any entity without enough energy (of any kind) in their possession will not be admitted into the temple, but any entity that is not Cubekon in origin will be
				destroyed.</p>
				<p> - But... why would the Cubekons want to keep out any intruders if their core goal was to learn more about Terraria? It is because the Cuboids are <i>protecting
				something...</i></p>
				<p> - The Cuboids seem to be a more advanced civilization beyond the capabilities of the Lihzard and Martians alike. Their final technological goal is their
				eventual transformation into a singularity, namely <a is="a-link">Quantux</a>. Quantux is the final collection of all information the Cuboids' have gathered, however,
				Quantux is still in an incomplete state due to the lack of materials and energy necessary to complete it. Due to this, Quantux
				and cannot function properly.</p></p>
