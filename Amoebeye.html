				The <b>Amoebeye</b> is a [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] [link enemy | | Enemies.html] that occasionally spawns in the [link Riven Hive].
				It will slowly approach the player from the edge of the screen and will have considerable [link defense | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense] until it enters its "enraged" state.
				Once the player draws near, the Amoebeye will fire a bubble at the player in an attempt to capture them that instills [link Riven Assimilation | | Assimilation.html] on them until it disappears.
				The Amoebeye will then enter its enraged state and lower its defense, charging at the player for a swift kill.

				<p>
					 - The Amoebeye moves very slowly towards the player, but can float through walls.
					The greatest way to eliminate it is by using weapons with high base damage and/or [link armor penetration | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense#Armor_penetration].
					If none of the weapons are strong enough to attack it, simply avoid it by out manuevering it.
