			<p>
				<b>Buffs</b> are positive status effects granted to the player upon consuming, equipping or otherwise activating various items.
				Active buffs are shown as icons below the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory#Hotbar_(10_slots)">hotbar</a>, along with their remaining durations/severities.
				Buffs are usually positive or bengign effects, in contrast with <a is="a-link">debuffs</a>, over which the player has much less control.
				<a is="a-link">Pets</a>, light pets, <a is="a-link">minions</a> and <a is="a-link">mounts</a> also have their own associated buffs while they are activated.
