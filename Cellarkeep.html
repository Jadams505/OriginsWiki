				The <b>Cellarkeep</b> is an [link enemy | | Enemies.html] found in the [link Dungeon | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dungeon].
				They behave and look similar to their [link Angry Bones | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Angry_Bones] counterparts, except that they will throw rolling explosive barrels whenever a player is within range.
				The explosive barrels they throw explode when making contact with the player or a high-enough wall, dealing splash damage and destroying tiles for a considerable area.
