				The <b>Cellarkeep</b> is an <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> found in the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dungeon">Dungeon</a>.
				They behave and look similar to their <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Angry_Bones">Angry Bones</a> counterparts, except that they will throw rolling explosive barrels whenever a player is within range.
				The explosive barrels they throw explode when making contact with the player or a high-enough wall, dealing splash damage and destroying tiles for a considerable area.

					 - Unlike the strategies used to avoid Angry Bones, Cellarkeeps are capable of throwing their barrels upwards to hit the player.
					Because of this, it is advisable to keep your distance.
