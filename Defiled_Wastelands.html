			<p><i>"The Defiled lives by its means but even that is too much for Terraria..."</i> - The <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a></p>

			<div id="table-of-contents"></div>

			<p>The <b>Defiled Wastelands</b> is one of the two new <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Evil_biomes">world-evil</a> biomes added by Terraria Origins. The Defiled adopts a harsher, greyscaled appearance<br>
			compared to the other biomes to show how anything affected by it is removed of any thought or will. The Defiled behaves differently to the other<br>
			evils in many regards and has a unique path during playthroughs. Navigating through the wastelands can be extremely difficult as massive [link Defiled Stone] spikes are<br>
			littered all throughout blocking the path.
			<div> <img src="Images/Spikes.png" alt="Spikes in the Wastelands" style="float:right;width:200px;height:155px;">
			Despite being the counterpart to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Corruption">Corruption</a>, the caverns are most similar to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Crimson">Crimson</a>. The Defiled Caverns are laid out as veins that branch out really far<br>
			from its circular core which contains the [link Defiled Heart]. A [link Defiled Fissure] may be present at the end of each underground vein. The Defiled Fissures can also be<br>
			protected by a thin layer of [link Defiled Stone]. The Defiled is significantly harder to deal with compared to other evils as purifying it will prove futile as it can quickly<br>
			reclaim lost ground in [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] and features enemies that can regenerate depending on their health. The only way to eradicate the Defiled is by destroying the<br>
			[link Defiled Heart], which requires a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pwnhammer">Pwnhammer</a> in order to destroy it.</p>

				<summary>Spread<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>The spread of the Defiled Wastelands behaves very differently from other evils. It spreads quicker than its alternatives in pre-Hardmode, but its spread does<br>
				not speed up any faster after the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wall_of_Flesh">Wall of Flesh</a> has been defeated. Additionally, its spread is unaffected by the defeat of [link Plantera | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Plantera]. The Defiled also reclaims<br>
				purified tiles rapidly in [link Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode] until the [link Defiled Heart] has been smashed preventing spread altogether. <i>All</i> Defiled Hearts in the world must be destroyed in<br>
				order to halt the spread.</p>
			</details>

			<details class="section" id="Defiled Desert and Snow" open>
				<summary>Defiled Desert and Snow<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>Unlike the other evils, the Defiled always can be present in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Desert">Deserts</a> and <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Snow_biome">Snow Biomes</a> and even spread freely in them. Not much changes with a Defiled Desert<br>
				and the wastelands as [link Defiled Trees | | Defiled_Tree.html], spikes, and other foliage can still spawn on the [link Defiled Sand].</p>

				<summary>Notes<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p> - It is worth noting that spikes in the Defiled Wastelands are generated with the world and cannot grow on clentaminated land.<br>
				- The [link Defiled Amalgamation] will only spawn when the player is standing on the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Layers">surface</a> of the world.<br>
				- The Defiled can be manually spread by using [link Defiled Seeds | | Defiled_Seed.html], [link Defiled Powder], [link White Water], or the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Clentaminator">Clentaminator</a> with [link White Solution], obtainable from the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Steampunker">Steampunker</a> during a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Moon">Blood Moon</a> in Crimson worlds.
				- All Defiled enemies besides the Defiled Amalgamation cannot regenerate health below 11 health due to the nature at which they heal.</p>

				<summary>Tips<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					- When navigating the Defiled Wastelands bring a lot of bombs and torches as it gets really dark at night in the wastelands and bombs for blowing a hole<br>
					through spikes in the way.
					- Defiled enemies have an exponential regeneration rate meaning that the lower health they have the faster they regenerate. This rate can be expressed by: Life Gain per second = 60 ï¿½ (Current life/10).

				<summary>Trivia<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p> - The Defiled was originally planned to have something to do with corrupted code, but for the namesake and consistency of the mod, it was later changed to<br>
				better fit the feel of Terraria.
				<p> - When the Defiled Wastelands is in the world, the indicator during world generation will be white and green and the other will be black to resemble the only<br>
				two prominent colors in the Defiled.</p>
				<img src="Images/IconDefiled.png" alt="The indicator in the world creation menu." style="float:right;width:120px;height:120px;">
				<p> - The Defiled Caverns represents some kind of circulatory system to hint at what the Defiled might actually be.</p>
				<p> - If the Origins Music mod is not enabled the Corruption theme will instead play whenever the player enters the Wastelands.</p>
				<p> - The "Shattered Reform" theme will play if the [link Mimic Armor] route is chosen when entering the Defiled Wastelands. The song is an heavy alteration of the Defiled melody.</p>

				<p><h1>The Defiled</h1>
				<p>The Defiled Wastelands was an entity unleashed when the [link Dusk] lost control of the dark forces of Terraria causing an imbalance. Ever since its freedom, it has<br>
				taken form onto the landscape of the Terraria world and used it as a way to grow. The Defiled has had enough time to have a sizeable hold on the landscape<br>
				and even take control of the life present on Terraria. The Defiled is not a place, it is a living being, and it is intelligent too. The Defiled creatures the Terrarian<br>
				faces are merely its immune system and work force. The Defiled being creates these machinations using the nervous system of the original host for control<br>
				and chunks made of Defiled matter to construct them from the ground up. These machinations are held together and move around with the use of Defiled<br>
				spirits, which act as a force and glue that binds it all together.
				<div>
				The Defiled is guided by no motive, it is just a being of pure dark energy that just wants to survive, and it will do <i>anything</i> to do so. It serves as a threat to<br>
				the Terraria world and acts as a parasite, feeding off of it. As soon as the Defiled had grown large enough, the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> was alerted of its presence. The Dryad<br>
				has a lot to say about the Defiled and even mentions how her fellow kin have struggled to contain it and banish it to the [link Dusk] after much effort. The Defiled<br>
				is so resistant to the purity that attempting to purify it is ultimately futile without hindering it. It also has become more powerful ever since it was released<br>
				from the Dusk according to the Dryad's history.</p>
