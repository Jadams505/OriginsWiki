			<div id="table-of-contents"></div>

			<p>The <b>Defiled Wastelands</b> is one of the two new <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Evil_biomes">world-evil</a> biomes added by Terraria Origins The Defiled adopts a harsher, greyscaled appearance compared<br>
			to the other biomes to show how anything affected by it is removed of any thought or will. The Defiled behaves differently to the other evils in many<br>
			regards and has a unique path during playthroughs. Navigating through the wastelands can be extremely difficult as massive [link Defiled Stone] spikes are littered all throughout blocking the path.<div> <img src="Images/Spikes.png" alt="Spikes in the Wastelands" style="float:right;width:200px;height:155px;"> Despite being the counterpart to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Corruption">Corruption</a>, the caverns are most similar to the<br>
			<a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Crimson">Crimson</a>. The Defiled Caverns are laid out as veins that branch out really far from its circular core which contains the [link Defiled Heart]. A [link Defiled Fissure]<br>
			may be present at the end of each underground vein. The Defiled Fissures can also be protected by a thin layer of [link Defiled Stone]. The Defiled is<br>
			significantly harder to deal with compared to other evils as purifying it will prove futile as it can quickly reclaim lost ground in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> and<br>
			features enemies that can regenerate depending on their health. The only way to eradicate the Defiled is by destroying the [link Defiled Heart], which<br>
			requires a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pwnhammer">Pwnhammer</a> in order to destroy it.
			The Defiled has a few quirks with its spread style that can be explained down below.</p> <img src="Images/Heart.png" alt="The Defiled Heart" style="width:300px;height:196px;">

				<summary>Spread</summary>
				<p>The spread of the Defiled Wastelands behaves very differently from other evils. It spreads quicker than its alternatives in pre-Hardmode, but its spread<br>
				does not speed up any faster after the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wall_of_Flesh">Wall of Flesh</a> has been defeated. Additionally, its spread is unaffected by the defeat of <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Plantera">Plantera</a>. The Defiled also<br>
				reclaims purified tiles rapidly in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> until the [link Defiled Heart] has been smashed preventing spread altogether. <i>All</i> Defiled Hearts in the world must be destroyed in order to halt the spread.</p>

				<summary>Defiled Desert and Snow</summary>
				<p>Unlike the other evils, the Defiled always can be present in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Desert">Deserts</a> and <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Snow_biome">Snow Biomes</a> and even spread freely in them. Not much changes with a Defiled Desert<br>
				and the wastelands as [link Defiled Trees], spikes, and other foliage can still spawn on the [link Defiled Sand].</p>

				<summary>Notes</summary>
				<p> - It is worth noting that spikes in the Defiled Wastelands are generated with the world and cannot grow on clentaminated land.<br>
				- The [link Defiled Amalgamation] will only spawn when the player is standing on the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Layers">surface</a> of the world.<br>
				 - The Defiled can be manually spread by using [link Defiled Seeds], [link Defiled Powder], [link White Water], or the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Clentaminator">Clentaminator</a> with [link White Solution],<br>
				 obtainable from the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Steampunker">Steampunker</a> during a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_Moon">Blood Moon</a> in Crimson worlds.</p>

				<p> - The Defiled was originally planned to have something to do with corrupted code, but for the namesake and consistency of the mod, it was later changed<br>
				to better fit the feel of Terraria.
				<p> - When the Defiled Wastelands is in the world, the indicator during world generation will be white and green and the other will be black to resemble the only two prominent colors in the Defiled.</p>
				<img src="Images/IconDefiled.png" alt="The indicator in the world creation menu." style="float:right;width:120px;height:120px;">
				<p> - The Defiled Caverns represents some kind of circulatory system to hint at what the Defiled might actually be.</p>

				<p><h1>The Defiled</h1>
				<p>The Defiled Wastelands was an entity unleashed when the [link Dusk] lost control of the dark forces of Terraria causing an imbalance. Ever since its freedom, it has taken form<br>
				onto the landscape of the Terraria world and used it as a way to grow. The Defiled has had enough time to have a sizeable hold on the landscape and even take<br>
				control of the life present on Terraria. The Defiled is not a place, it is a living being, and it is intelligent too. The Defiled creatures the Terrarian faces<br>
				are merely its immune system and work force. The Defiled being creates these machinations using the nervous system of the original host for control and chunks<br>
				made of Defiled matter to construct them from the ground up. These machinations are held together and move around with the use of Defiled Spirits, which act as<br>
				a force and glue that binds it all together.
				<div>
				The Defiled is guided by no motive, it is just a being of pure dark energy that just wants to survive, and it will do <i>anything</i> to do so. It serves as a<br>
				threat to the Terraria world and acts as a parasite, feeding off of it. As soon as the Defiled had grown large enough, the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> was alerted of its prescense.<br>
				The Dryad has a lot to say about the Defiled and even mentions how her fellow kin have struggled to contain it and banish it to the [link Dusk] after much<br>
				effort. The Defiled is so resistant to the purity that attempting to purify it is ultimately futile without hindering it. It also has become more powerful ever<br>
				since it was released from the Dusk according to the Dryad's history.</p>
