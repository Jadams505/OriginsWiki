			<p>
				<b>Paintings</b> are decorative [link furniture] items that can be placed on background [link walls].
				Each one is a framed image that depicts a particular scene, usually Terraria-related.
				Their tooltips generally contain a person's name, apparently intended to credit each painting's artist; although the names appear to be fictional, most of them correspond to the dedicated spriter for Origins, [link chee | | Developers.html].
				Paintings are highlighted by the [link Spelunker | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Spelunker_Potion] effect.
