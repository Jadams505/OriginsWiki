				<b>Wings</b> are <a is="a-link" href="Accessories.html">accessories</a> that allow the player to fly temporarily by pressing and holding the <b>Jump</b> key.
				Flight time is reset when the player rests on solid objects, including both standing on <a is="a-link" href="Blocks.html">blocks</a> and using climbing items like <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ropes">Ropes</a>, <a is="a-link" href="Hooks.html">hooks</a> and climbing accessories.
				Certain wing types provide different movement capabilities for the player.
				After the player has run out of flight time, holding the <b>Jump</b> key allows the player to slowly glide to the ground.
				Gliding fall speed can be increased by holding the <b>Down</b> key.
