				<b>Demolitionist weapons</b> are a new [link weapon class | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage#Damage_types] introduced in Origins based on pre-existing explosives.
				Demolitionist weapons are known for their explosive properties, which can utilize their area of effect for splash damage, area denial or crowd control.
				Demolitionist weapons generally offer the best offensive capabilities, but are very expensive compared to other weapon types and ammunition.
				There is also the added risk of the player [link damaging themselves | | Self_Damage.html] when nearby the explosion.
				Some Demolitionist weapons can be used for utility or tile destruction as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				Due to their nature, explosive weapons have specific quirks that other damage classes are not normally affected by.
				Explosive weapons are more harshly affected by [link defense | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense] in order to offset their high base damage.
				Additionally, all weapons and equipment considered explosive receive half the benefit from any [link generic | | Generic_Damage.html] boosts, including boosts from accessory modifiers.

				<p>
					 - Many of the [link ranged weapons] classified as a launcher or consumable explosive have been officially re-classed as either "ranged-explosive" or "thrown explosive".
					This does not remove functionality from vanilla launchers to benefit from any ranged bonuses that may be superior to current explosive bonuses while also promoting hybridization in loadouts.<br> 
					 - All vanilla and Origins launchers, except the [link Rocket Launcher | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Rocket_Launcher] and [link Snowman Cannon | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Snowman_Cannon], can use both [link https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Rockets] and [link Canisters] as ammunition.<br>
					 - Explosive weapons and equipment receive half the benefit from [link generic | | Generic_Damage.html] boosts for balance reasons.
					This includes any boosts provided by accessory modifiers.<br>
					 - Explosive weapons are more harshly affected by enemy [link defense | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense] than other damage classes to offset their high base damage.<br>
					 - [link Explosive Artery], [link Haggard Artery], [link Protozoa Food] and [link Volatile Gelatin | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Volatile_Gelatin] benefit from explosive and generic boosts, but are not considered boost gear in of themselves.

					 - Non-thrown explosives benefit from effects of [link Ammo Boxes | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ammo_Box].<br>
					 - The [link Ichor | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Ichor], [link Torn], [link Solvent] and [link https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Broken_Armor] debuffs are excellent ways of increasing the effectiveness of explosives.<br>
					 - A strategy with some explosive weapons called "Self-Damage Dodging" (or "SDD" for short), involves the player utilizing the decreased damage received from hurting themselves from their own explosives to avoid an incoming attack that would deal more damage.
					It is generally a good idea to maximize your self-damage protection in order to perform this without much of a cost to your health.
