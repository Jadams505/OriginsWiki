					<b>When picked up for the first time:</b>
					 - "Greetings, Terrarian. I installed my data onto this Fabricator's chip in hopes of finding you. Glad I could be of assistance."
					 - "I need your help, my creator is likely deceased and I need you to carry out her mission. Please read my logs for more information."
					<b>When picked up:</b>
					 - "Greetings again, Terrarian."
					<b>When [link Potato Battery] is in the player's [link inventory | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Inventory]:</b>
					 - "Conflicting authority, Terrarian. I do advise purging the other unit."
					<b>When [link Protomind] is in the player's inventory:</b>
					 - "Conflicting authority, Terrarian. The Protomind may be an advanced model but that unit will hinder your abilities."

					 - "W-what? My creator is still alive?"
					<b>Player death:</b>
					 - "Oh. According to my calculations, your death was highly improbable."
