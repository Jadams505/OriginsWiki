			<p>
				The <b>Defiled Amalgamation</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode], [link Defiled | | Defiled_Wastelands.html]-themed [link boss | | Bosses.html] resembling a bird-like, faintly-humanoid appearance while having two large fang-like appendages on both of its sides.
				It spawns off-screen nearby the player after destroying 3 [link Defiled Fissures] or when the player uses a [link Nerve Impulse Manipulator] anywhere in the Wastelands.
				It is advisable to have a direct pathway to the surface of the Defiled Wastelands before doing so as the player will be unable to attack it with blocks in the way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Defeating the Defiled Amalgamation and the [link Defiled Swarmers | | Defiled_Swarmer.html] it summons, are the only ways of obtaining [link Undead Chunks | | Undead_Chunk.html], and are one of the ways of obtaining usable quantities of [link Lost Ore].
				Defeating the Amalgamation for the first time also allows the [link Tavernkeep | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Tavernkeep] [link NPC | | NPCs.html] to spawn as the Unconcious Man, and allows [link meteorites | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteorite_(biome)] to land.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Defiled Amalgamation has multiple behaviors during its encounter, which can be pretty easily telegraphed to responsive players.
				The frequency of its behaviors are set to a counter where it does a random behavior at every 300 count.
				It dashes at the player, summons spike-splosions and can regenerate health.
				These behaviors can be explained in greater detail below.

					<summary>Behavior<span class="divider"></span></summary>

					<h3>Approach</h3>
					<p>
						Once 3 Defiled Fissures have been smashed or a Nerve Impulse Manipulator has been used, the Defiled Amalgamation will spawn off-screen and rapidly approach either a 2 o'clock or 10 o'clock position relative to the player depending on which direction is spawns from the player.
						Whenever the player gets just out of its reach in combat, it will position itself the same way.
					</p>
					<h3>Sidestep</h3>
					<p>
						The Amalgamation performs a sidestep randomly to swap between the aforementioned 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions.
						This behavior can also be used to dodge attacks or intercept the player.
					</p>
					<h3>Attacks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Dash Attack</strong> -
							The Amalgamation will attempt to hit the player with a fast dash.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Projectile Spray</strong> -
							The Amalgamation will spread its appendages out to fire 6-8 projectile sprays that cause a spike-splosion whenever they are within proximity of the player or collide with a tile.
							It will use this attack often whenever the player is concealed, which also allows the projectile spray to go through tiles to reach the player in hard-to-reach spots.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Beckoning Roar</strong> -
							The Amalgamation will spawn Defiled Swarmers when reaching half (every third in [link Expert | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode] and every quarter in [link Master | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode] respectively) of its health to overwhelm the player.
							The amount of Swarmers spawned increases with difficulty and the amount of players present in the world.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Burnout Attack</strong> -
							The Amalgamation's burnout attack involves an inital 3-dash frenzy in a set interval followed by a 7-second (3.5 seconds in Expert and 2.34 seconds in Master) rejuvenation period in which it will be immobile and vulnerable to attacks.
							The rejuvenation period increases its behavior count by 100 allowing it to perform any behavior other than another burnout attack immediately after.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Special</h3>
					<p>
						The Amalgamation additionally has a flat life regeneration divided by thresholds.
						These thresholds are present at every eighth (1/8) of its health (every sixth in Expert and every quarter in Master), and it will regenerate up to these thresholds until its health has been lowered past them.
						It regenerates at a rate of 8 life per second (10hp/s in Expert and 12hp/s in Master).

					<summary>Tips<span class="divider"></span></summary>
					<p>
						 - The Defiled Amalgamation will not spawn after smashing 3 Defiled Fissures if the player reloads the world.<br>
						 - When considering fighting the Defiled Amalgamation, plan ahead and build a proper arena to be above or below it often with platforms laid out in multiple vertical layers.
						Be sure to be fast when it rejuvenates from a knockout attack to deal optimal damage.<br>
						 - Prepare for when it spawns after smashing the last Defiled Fissure as you will need to find your way back to the surface in order to strike it.

					<p>
						 - Unlike the rest of the world-evils, the Defiled Amalgamation does not have a Hardmode, mechanical equivalent similar to the [link Brain of Cthulhu | | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Brain_of_Cthulhu].<br>
						 - Due to its long name, the Defiled Amalgamation is often abbreviated as "DA", and is then occasionally re-lengthened as "District Attorney" or "DeviantArt".
						Appropriately, its localization for [link April Fools] is changed to "District Attorney".
