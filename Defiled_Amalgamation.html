			<p>
				The <b>Defiled Amalgamation</b> is a [link pre-Hardmode | $default | https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode] boss that resides in the [link Defiled Wastelands]. It can be summoned when the player is on the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Layers#Surface">surface</a> of the world after destroying 3 [link Defiled Fissures] or when the player uses a [link Nerve Impulse Manipulator] anywhere in the Wastelands.<br>
				It resembles a bird-like, faintly-humanoid appearance while having two large fang-like appendages on both of its sides. These appendages reduce incoming damage by 65% when attacked from them (80% in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">Expert</a>, and 100% in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">Master</a>).
			</p>

			<p>
				The Defiled Amalgamation has multiple behaviors during its encounter. It dashes at the player, summons spikes, and can regenerate health. These
				behaviors can be explained in greater detail below.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Defiled Amalgamation is the only source of the [link Undead Chunk] material and is additionally a method to obtaining usable amounts of [link Lost Ore]. Furthermore, defeating the Amalgamation allows the
				<a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Tavernkeep">Tavernkeep</a> to spawn.

					<summary>Behavior<span class="divider"></span></summary>

					<h3>Approach</h3>
					<p>
						When the Amalgamation approaches the player, it will use its appendages to protect itself as it slowly descends to the ground whilst following the
						player's horizontal position. When close enough, it will drop and prepare to attack the player.
					</p>
					<h3>Sidestep</h3>
					<p>
						The Defiled Amalgamation will often perform a sidestep to dodge incoming attacks or to move closer to the player.
					</p>
					<h3>Attacks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Dash Attack</strong> -
							The Amalgamation will attempt to hit the player with a fast dash. It will charge at the player with its appendages swaying to its movement.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Uplift Attack</strong> -
							The Defiled Amalgamation will charge an attack where it balls up then proceeds to lift its appendages up, summoning Defiled spike-splosions that expand
							outward. The "cast" used to spawn them can penetrate tiles and will only explode when nearby the player.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Summon Attack</strong> -
							The Amalgamation will spawn [link Defiled Swarmers | $default | Defiled_Swarmer.html] when reaching half of its health to attack the player.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Knockout Attack</strong> -
							The Amalgamation's final attack is a triple-dash attack strike, but when it finishes the strike it will rest in place unable to move for 9 seconds
							(6 seconds in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">Expert</a>, and 3 seconds in <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">Master</a>).
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Special</h3>
					<p>
						The Amalgamation additionally has an active regeneration consistent with other Defiled [link Enemies] with a few key differences: the Defiled Amalgamation regenerates in thresholds AND its regeneration rate is flat. <i>Flat</i> regeneration basically means that its regeneration rate does not accelerate from recieved damage.
						These thresholds are present at every eighth (1/8) of its health (1/6 in expert mode and 1/4 in master mode), and it will regenerate up to these thresholds until its health has been lowered past them.

						- Explosives can deal their full damage to the Amalgamation even when attacking the appendages due to splash damage.<br>

						- Unlike the rest of the world-evils, the Defiled Amalgamation does not have a Hardmode, mechanical equivalent similar to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Brain_of_Cthulhu">Brain of Cthulhu</a>.<br>
						- Due to its long name, the Defiled Amalgamation is often abbreviated as "DA", and is then occasionally re-lengthened as "District Attorney" or "DeviantArt".

					<p><h1>The Defiled Amalgamation</h1>
					<p>
						The Defiled Amalgamation, like all creatures in the Wastelands, was once an ordinary living organism in the world until it was cursed by the Defiled. The<br>
						creature that was once the Amalgamation started to go about tasks in the [link Defiled Wastelands] in order to preserve its habitat until it grew to a much larger<br>
						size by collecting more chunks overtime and by even absorbing other Defiled beings. The Amalgamation eventually struggled to get any larger as its rate of<br>
						decay became more substantial and resorted to maintaining its size by actively hunting anything that comes into its territory. It marks its territory around<br>
						the openings of the caverns in the Wastelands and seems to protect the [link Defiled Fissures] as if they were its own. Despite its uniqueness, it too is merely a<br>
						proxy of the Defiled.
