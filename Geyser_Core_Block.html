				The <b>Geyser Core Block</b> is a type of <a is="a-link" href="Blocks.html">block</a> found inside of hydrothermal vents within the <a is="a-link">Brine Pool</a>.
				It is currently unobtainable and purely visual block as its only purpose is to emit a large amount of smoke.
				This block also attracts <a is="a-link">Vent Hoppers</a> and inflicts damage to any players that get too close to it.
