				The <b>Geyser Core Block</b> is a type of [link block | | Blocks.html] found inside of hydrothermal vents within the [link Brine Pool].
				It is currently unobtainable and purely visual block as its only purpose is to emit a large amount of smoke.
				This block also attracts [link Vent Hoppers] and inflicts damage to any players that get too close to it.
