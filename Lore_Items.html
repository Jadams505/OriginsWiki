				<b>Lore items</b> are items that come with supporting information in the form of a story or compositional note.
				Lore items are usually indicated by the "You hear whispers nearby..." or similar phrases in their tooltip where, if the player has acquired the <a is="a-link">Journal</a>, they can use the <b>Inspect</b> key (in Origins' configuration menu) to unlock its journal entry.
				The lore of Origins as a whole offers nothing to the gameplay and only serves to enrich the world and/or make it seem more lively.
