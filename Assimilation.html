				<b>Assimilation</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Game_mechanics">mechanic</a> added by Origins to increase the difficulty and immersion of the vanilla and modded <a is="a-link">evil biomes</a>.
				Each of the four currently-implemented evils have their own unique versions of assimilation, which have different effects and consequences as the player gets closer to being fully assimilated.
				Assimilation builds up over time as the player is inflicted with it from the unqiue methods each evil has to administer it, so the player will need to be more careful when venturing into each of the specific evil biomes.
				<a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Corruption">The Corruption</a> inflicts higher-than-normal amounts of assimilation from select enemies, <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Crimson">the Crimson</a> inflicts assimilation from most of its enemies for less but can also inflict it through <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Plants#Thorny_bushes">thorny bushes</a>, the <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Wastelands.html">Defiled</a> inflicts it from all of its antibodies but in smaller amounts, and finally, the <a is="a-link" href="Riven_Hive.html">Riven</a> inflicts riven assimilation in reduced amounts from its enemies, pools of amebic gel you fall in and any Riven rainstorms you're exposed to.
				At 100% of any assimilation, the player will be instantly killed, so management of it is vital for survival.
				See below for details on what you can do to manage your assimilation.

				Furthermore, the specific effects of each assimilation type is explained in greater detail below:

				<summary>Assimilation effects<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<h3>Types</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Corrupt Assimilation</b><br>
					 - The player's <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage">damage</a>, <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Attack_speed">attack speed</a>, <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Critical_hit">critical strike chance</a> and <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Knockback">knockback</a> are all reduced by half the percentage of Corrupt assimilation they currently have for up to -50% of their normal values.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Crimson Assimilation</b><br>
					 - While inflicted with Crimson assimilation, the player will have an increasing chance to randomly receive either <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bleeding">Bleeding</a> or <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Confused">Confused</a> for random durations that increase in length depending on how assimilated they are.
					Crimson assimilation can be especially devastating as it gets more severe and should be avoided at all costs.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Defiled Assimilation</b><br>
					<i>Requires 12.5% Defiled assimilation</i><br>
					 - At this level of Defiled assimilation the player will be permanently inflicted with <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Weak">Weak</a>.<br>
					<i>Requires 35% Defiled assimilation</i><br>
					 - At this level of Defiled assimilation the player will be permanently inflicted with <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Broken_Armor">Broken Armor</a>.<br>
					<i>Requires 50% Defiled assimilation</i><br>
					 - At this level of Defiled assimilation the player will be permanently inflicted with increasingly-severe <a is="a-link" href="Rasterized.html">Raster</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Riven Assimilation</b><br>
					 - With Riven assimilation you are permanently applied with <a is="a-link">Torn</a> with a severity directly correlated with your assimilation percentage.
					An <a is="a-link">Antisolve Potion</a> can serve as a temporary solution to avoid being inflicted with Torn, but it will not remove your Riven assimilation.
					Once the effects of the potion have run out, Torn will be promptly reapplied.

				<summary>Assimilation management<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					Assimilation can be properly managed by employing specific items provided by the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a>.
					She sells the <a is="a-link">Mojo Injection</a>, <a is="a-link">Cleansing Station</a> and <a is="a-link">Mojo Flask</a> for the player to use to extend their trips to each of the world evils.
					Mojo injections permanently apply a small passive rate of assimilation cleanse factor, so assimilation is handled over extended periods of time.
					Cleansing Stations are functional <a is="a-link">furniture</a> items that can be placed and used outside of the evil biomes to cleanse the player and refill Mojo Flasks.
					Mojo Flasks are storage containers that have five charges of 20% assimilation cleansing before they need to be refilled.
					Whenever any of the dedicated cleansing items are used, all of the assimilation types are equally affected for the full amount of the cleanse.

					For <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Crimson">the Crimson</a>: "{Name of player} was consumed by the Crimson's lies."<br>
					For the <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Wastelands.html">Defiled</a>: "{Name of player} was warped to the Defiled Will."<br>
