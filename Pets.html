				<b>Pets</b> are creatures that follow the player around.
				They are completely invincible and have no set duration.
				When summoned, they will give the player a <a is="a-link" href="Buffs.html">buff</a> with the same name as the pet.
				A pet will follow the player until they die, summon a different pet, leave the world or cancel the associated buff.
				The equipped pet can be seen on the player selection menu alongside the player.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most pets are purely cosmetic and do not consume any <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Summon_weapons#minion_slots">minion slots</a>.
				Some pets known as Light Pets can emit light and take up their own dedicated slots alongside regular pets.
